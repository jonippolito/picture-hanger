"""

APP_HOW_IT_WORKS = """
A simple flowchart can help overwhelmed students fit voting into their schedule. This app tries to draw a custom decision tree based on a teacher's answers to a few fields.\n\nOnce you've completed the form, pasted the resulting code snippet into the provided Mermaid Editor link to draw a flowchart; click Fullscreen for a code-free diagram that you can share in class or online.\n\nThe app does not pretend to have advice for every scenario, since possible options will depend on timing and location; for example, in some states it may be too late for students to request absentee ballots. Instead the responsibility is on the user to assess the available options beforehand, and then use this tool to present them to students as concisely as possible.\n\nBe sure to check the results. To modify them, add a prompt at bottom to revise the chart or reload the page to start over. (You will also need to paste the new code into the Mermaid editor to create a new fullscreen chart.)\n\nThis app uses John Swope's open-source AI MicroApp framework (AppsForEducation.ai) to send a custom prompt to OpenAI and/or other services. It's a project of the Learning With AI initiative (LearnWithAI.org) and is unaffiliated with Ballotpedia or any political party.
