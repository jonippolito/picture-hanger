  AI Microapps are the simplest free way to build AI-powered web apps that you can personalize and share. 
</p>

<p>Let's explain with an ✨AI-powered✨ Haiku App</p>

<p>First, we configure about 10 lines to configure the app. Some lines configure two text fields to gather the users name and a favorite activity. The last line is the AI prompt that we'll send to AI with the user's input. It looks like this:</p>

<p>Here is the app we get:</p>

<p>So what next?</p>
<p>Once you've mastered the basics, you can start building customized apps for those long, complicated prompts that you always have trouble remembering exactly how you did them. <i>And</i> you can share your apps with others, allowing them to quickly and intuitively use an AI chain that you've developed. </p>
<p>AI Microapps was built by an educator for the education sector. It works well as either:</p>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>A course accelerator</strong> - Build and share your customized <a href="https://mcq-wizard.streamlit.app" target="_blank" alt="Multiple Choice Question Generator">Multiple Choice Question generators</a>, Lesson Plan Builders, <a href="https://alt-text.streamlit.app" target="_blank">Alt Text Wizards</a> and more. </li>
      <li><strong>Assessment &amp; Feedback Tools</strong> - You can create AI-powered exercises for your students like an <a href="https://ai-debate.streamlit.app" target="_blank">AI Debate</a> tool about this week's lesson, or a <a href="https://critical-thinking.streamlit.app" target="_blank">critical thinking practice app</a> that is guided by your instruction. </li>
   </ul>
<p>AI MicroApps have nearly limitless customization capabilities and work with the most popular AI models, so you can make nearly any app and share it with anyone</p>

<p>Apps can be deployed to the web via <a href="https://streamlit.io/" target="_blank" alt="Streamlit Hosting">Streamlit</a> for free and nearly instantly.</p>

<p>Happy Building!</p>
